# VineGenerator

<!-- PURPOSE -->
## Purpose of the Project
This project was created for the hackathon Hack UMass in 2019. This was meant as a test run to see what we could accomplish as a team. I worked with three other peers to create this project. The project itself was a for fun hack. 

<!-- WHAT IT DOES -->
## What it Does
We wanted to make a simple program so when a button labeled happy, neutral or sad is pushed, a preloaded vine is outputed by the speaker. We made this sound generator to lift moods up with just the press of a button. If you are sad, you press the sad button and the sound that follows should lift your spirits and make you feel happier. There are only a few sounds that are preloaded but there's plenty of room to add more!

<!-- WHAT WAS USED TO CREATE THE PROJECT -->
## What was Used to Create the Project

The following is a list of physical elements that were used to help this project come to life:
  - breadboard 
  - simple buttons
  - wires
  - speaker
  - Raspberry Pi

<!-- HOW THE PROJECT CAME TO LIFE -->
## How Was it Built

### Coding Aspect

Inorder for this project to work, we had to code the project and then transfer it onto an SD card for the Raspberry Pi to read. The code is very simple and basic. We downloaded the audio files as .wav files inorder for the sound to work. We then put the audio files into a list corresponding to the emotion. There are 4 sounds per emotion. It then randomly plays one of the 4 preloaded sounds in the list when a button is pressed.

### Hardware Aspect

The Raspberry Pi was connected by connecting wires and then soldering them onto the breadboard. The spots where the wires are placed onto the breadboard are where the buttons are placed. We also connected a speaker into the audio jack of the Raspberry Pi so the sound can be played. Below is an image of the set up of the hardware of the project.

<!-- CHALLENGES FACED -->
## Challenges Faced
Because my peers and I were freshmen taking introductory Computer Science / Computer Engineering classes at the time of the hackathon, we ran into a few issues. 

One of the issues was that we could not figure out how to get the buttons to work correctly. It was our first time working with a breadboard and Raspberry Pi. We could not figure out how to correctly affix the buttons to the breadboard on our own so we asked a mentor to help us out. In the end, our project ended up working as intended.

Another issue that we ran into was we had limited amount of time to code the project as we spent most of the Hackathon timing looking for a way to integrate software and hardware so that our Computer Science teammate could have something to help us with. 

<!-- WHAT WE COULD DO DIFFERENTLY LATER -->
## Possible Things we Can Do / Add to the Existing Project

Something we could do in the future is possibly making a large extensive database of sounds so that we can make the sounds that are outputted more random. We could also make an app so that the user can upload their own sounds to the database by the use of an app.
