# VineGenerator

<!-- PURPOSE -->
## Purpose of the Project
This project was created for the hackathon Hack UMass in 2019. This was meant as a test run to see what we could accomplish as a team. I worked with three other peers to create this project. The project itself was a for fun hack. 

<!-- WHAT IT DOES -->
## What it Does
We wanted to make a simple program so when a button labeled happy, neutral or sad is pushed, a preloaded vine is outputed by the speaker. We made this sound generator to lift moods up with just the press of a button. If you are sad, you press the sad button and the sound that follows should lift your spirits and make you feel happier. There are only a few sounds that are preloaded but there's plenty of room to add more!

<!-- WHAT WAS USED TO CREATE THE PROJECT -->
## What was Used to Create the Project

The following is a list of physical elements that were used to help this project come to life:
  - breadboard 
  - simple buttons
  - wires
  - speaker
  - Raspberry Pi

<!-- HOW THE PROJECT CAME TO LIFE -->
## How Was it Built

### Coding Aspect

Inorder for this project to work, we had to code the project and then transfer it onto an SD card for the Raspberry Pi to read. The code is very simple and basic. We downloaded the audio files as .wav files inorder for the sound to work. We then put the audio files into a list corresponding to the emotion. There are 4 sounds per emotion. It then randomly plays one of the 4 preloaded sounds in the list when a button is pressed.

### Hardware Aspect

The Raspberry Pi was connected by connecting wires and then soldering them onto the breadboard. The spots where the wires are placed onto the breadboard are where the buttons are placed. We also connected a speaker into the audio jack of the Raspberry Pi so the sound can be played. Below is an image of the set up of the hardware of the project.
